    Actuators. One of three optional parameters can be provided:
    "OnEq": if message equal to this parameter is received publish "ON", works
    with String messages
    "OnGT": if the message is greater than this value, publsih "ON", only works
    with messages that can be parsed to float.
    "OnLT": if the message is less than this value, publish "ON", only works
    with messages that can be parsed to float.

    If none of the optional parameters are present, the message is passes as is.
    All messages that don't match the comparison results in "OFF". If more than
    one is defined, OnEQ is first and OnGT is second and OnLT is last.

    This can be used to, for example, turn on an LED attached to a GPIO pin
    configured with RpiGpioActuator when a sensor has a given value.
    Configure this as a connection and configure both the sensor and the
    actuator to use this Connection.
