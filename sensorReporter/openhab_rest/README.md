# openHAB REST Connection

This Connection provides a two way connection to an openHAB instance.
I uses the REST API to publish Item updates and it subscribes to the SSE feed for Item commands.

## Dependencies

Uses [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) to issue the Item updates.

Uses [sseclient-py](https://pypi.org/project/sseclient-py/) to subscribe to the SSE feed.

```
sudo pip3 install requests
sudo pip3 install sseclient-py
```

### Actuator / sensor relevant parameters

To use an actuator or a sensor (a device) with a connection it has to define this in the device 'Connections:' parameter with a dictionary of connection names and connection related parameters (see Dictionary of connectors layout).
The openHAB REST connection uses following parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Restrictions                    | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Item`    | yes      | Alphanumeric & underscores only | specifies the topic to subscribe for actuator events and the return topic to publish the current device state / sensor reading. Device state is published as item update. Actuators are only triggerd on item commands |

### Dictionary of connectors layout
To configure a openHAB REST connection in a sensor / actuator use following layout:

```yaml
Connections:
    <connection_name>:
        <sensor_output_1>:
            Item: <some Item_name>
        <sensor_output_2>:
            Item: <some Item_name2>
    <connection_name2>:
        #etcetera
```
The available outputs are described at the sensor / actuator readme.

Some sensor / actuators have only a single output / input so the sensor_output section is not neccesary:

```yaml
Connections:
    <connection_name>:
        Item: <some Item_name>
```

## Example Configs

```yaml
Logging:
    Syslog: yes
    Level: INFO

Connection1:
    Class: openhab_rest.rest_conn.OpenhabREST
    Name: openHAB
    URL: http://localhost:8080
    RefreshItem: Test_Refresh
    openHAB-Version: 3.2
    API-Token: <API-Token generated from openHAB profil page>
    Level: INFO

SensorHeartbeart:
    Class: heartbeat.heartbeat.Heartbeat
    Connections:
       openHAB:
           FormatNumber:
               Item: heartbeat_num
           FormatString:
               Item: heartbeat_str
    Poll: 60
```

To detect when a sensor_reporter goes offline, use the Heartbeat and a timer in openHAB to detect when the heartbeat stops.

This connection has a passive disconnect detection.
Whenever a message to openHAB is send the reception of the message is checked.
If there is no message reception detected eg. after the restart of openHAB, sensor_reporter will automatically reconnect.
To make full use of this feature a Heartbeat every 60s is recommended.


## OpenHAB Setup
Login in openHAB as Admin and add a new point (settings > model > add point) for every sensor/actor to use with sensor_reporter.
You can add the point straight away to the [semantic model](https://www.openhab.org/docs/tutorial/model.html) of your smart home or do it later.
Obviously the point names in openHAB and in the sensor_reporter config have to be the identical.
Point label can be chosen freely.
The point type vary, see the plugin readme's for more information.

Note: on a setup with an sensor and an actuator with the same label, the actuator will not get triggered thru openHAB when an update on the destination happens. Use a local/mqtt connection for direct sensor actuator connections.
