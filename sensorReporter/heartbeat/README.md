# heartbeat.heartbeat.Heartbeat

The Heartbeat sensor is a utility to report the sensor_reporter uptime.
This reliable scheduled reporting could be used as a heartbeat and the messages can be used to see how long sensor_reporter has been online.
To detect if sensor_reporter is offline, the linked item on openHAB can use the [expire parameter](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/items.html#parameter-expire), which can be set via 'add metadata > expiration timer' in the item settings. 

## Dependencies

None.

## Parameters

`Level` | | DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR | When provided, sets the logging level for the sensor.
`Poll` | X | Positive number in seconds | How often to publish the uptime.

## Outputs
The Heartbeat has 2 outputs which can be configured within the 'Connections' section (Look at connection readme's for 'Actuator / sensor relevant parameters' for details).

Output | Purpose
